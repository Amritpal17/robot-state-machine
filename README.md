# robot-state-machine
This is a simple Python project that shows how a robot can use a finite state machine (FSM) to manage its states like idle, moving, charging, and error. The project includes test scripts using pytest to make sure all transitions work correctly, and thereâ€™s a diagram showing how the states connect.
